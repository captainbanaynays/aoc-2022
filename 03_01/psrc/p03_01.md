# Day 3 part 1 pseudo

- Setup a total sum var

- While getline does not return EOF:
	- Parse each line into two halves
		- Remove newline char at end
		- get length
		- divide by 2
		- create string splices for each of the halves and store
	- Iterate through first string splice using .chars()
	- For each character, iterate through the second array and check for match.
	- If match not found, throw error
	- If found, check for capitalization
		- If capitalized, subtract 'A' and add 27
		- if lowercase, subtract 'a' and add 1
	- add to total sum
- Print total sum
