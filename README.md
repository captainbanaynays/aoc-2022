# Advent of Code 2022

Listed in this directory are my solutions for the advent of code event for 2022.
I'm a little late to the party, but that's better than never!
I will be doing my best to code all of my solutions in Rust, in an attempt to learn the language.
What fun! Such Merry-making! Wheeee! ❄️ ❄️ ❄️ ❄️
